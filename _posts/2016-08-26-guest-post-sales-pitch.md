# **Guest Post Sales Pitch**

**Guest Posting** -- You are best to take a personal approach

Example:

Hey \[Insert Name Here\],

My name is \[insert your name here\]. I have been reading your blog and I saw the content on \[insert something personal about their blog that relates to what you want to pitch\]. I thought it was great and I have a \[insert mention of what you are trying to pitch and ensure it relates to what you wrote above\] which I think would be a perfect fit for your blog. Do you accept any guest posts at all?

I'll gladly send \[try to insert something here that you can give them otherwise state that you'll gladly send your content for their review\].

Looking forward to your next posts.

All the best,

\[insert your name\]
